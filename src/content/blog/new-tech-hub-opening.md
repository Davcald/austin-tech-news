East Austin is getting a major boost with the announcement of a new 50-acre tech campus. The development, called "Innovation East," will house multiple tech companies and is expected to create over 5,000 new jobs in the next five years.

The campus will feature state-of-the-art office spaces, co-working areas, and a startup incubator. Several major tech companies have already signed leases, including two Fortune 500 companies.

"This development represents our commitment to making Austin a leading tech hub while ensuring sustainable growth in our east side communities," says Mayor Thompson. The project includes plans for affordable housing and local business support programs.
